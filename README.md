# preloader

Essentially, a preloader is the very first part of the UI you see while waiting for a website or application to load. In other words, it’s the loading animation or static image that shows on your screen while the main app is loading in the background.

Often seen as no more but a gimmick to entertain the user it’s a crucial part of the UI and should not be overlooked in the development process as it plays a number of very important roles (we’ll cover this in a bit).

This little project contains steps on creating a custom preloader is HTML5, CSS£ and a JavaScript Library (jQuery).

Inline comments are available for quick guides, implementation and designing.
